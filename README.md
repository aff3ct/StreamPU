`StreamPU` is a **Domain Specific Embedded Language** (DSEL) for **streaming 
applications**. It comes in the form of a **C++11 library to link with**.

![Sequence and pipeline](./docs/assets/sequence_to_pipeline.svg)

Here are the main features of `StreamPU`:
  - Definition of dataflow components: **modules**, **tasks** and **sockets**
  - Elementary modules and tasks implementations
  - **Multi-threaded runtime** with **replication** and **pipeline** parallel 
    constructs

This DSEL/library is suitable for SDR systems, audio/video processing and more 
generally it matches single-rate Synchronous DataFlow (SDF) streaming 
applications.

Please note that this library was previously named `AFF3CT-core` as it was first 
extracted from [AFF3CT](https://github.com/aff3ct/aff3ct). Now that it is no 
longer specific to channel coding and digital communications, the project has 
been renamed to `StreamPU`, which is a more meaningful name.

## Linking with the Library

`StreamPU` exposes two CMake targets:
- `spu-shared-lib`: `StreamPU` shared library, includes and definitions
- `spu-static-lib`: `StreamPU` static library, includes and definitions

For now, the recommended way to use `StreamPU` is to add it as a 
`add_subdirectory` into your `CMakeList.txt` file. 

Let us suppose that we want to produce the `my-exe` executable that links with 
`StreamPU` static library, here is a minimal `CMakeLists.txt` file to 
generate the `my-exe` executable:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)

project(my_project CXX)

# require C++11 compiler ------------------------------------------------------
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# create the `my-exe` executable from `src/main.cpp` --------------------------
add_executable(my-exe ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/main.cpp)

# compile `StreamPU` static lib --------------------------------------------
option(SPU_COMPILE_STATIC_LIB "" ON) # compile the static lib
option(SPU_COMPILE_SHARED_LIB "" OFF) # do NOT compile the shared lib
option(SPU_TESTS "" OFF) # do NOT compile the tests
# here we suppose that `StreamPU` sources are located in `lib/streampu/`
add_subdirectory(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/streampu/)

# `my-exe` links with `StreamPU` static lib --------------------------------
target_link_libraries(my-exe PUBLIC spu-static-lib)
```

  * Contains many illustrative and simple use cases: **a good document to start 
    with `StreamPU`**
- [Developer documentation](https://aff3ct.github.io/streampu/)
  * Online doc that focuses on how `StreamPU` is built and works
  * Particularly **useful to learn how to modify `StreamPU` and to contribute**
